The Nobel Prize has been among the most prestigious international awards since 1901. Each year, awards are bestowed in chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. In addition to the honor, prestige, and substantial prize money, the recipient also gets a gold medal with an image of Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896), who established the prize.

The objective of this project is to explore and answer several questions related to this prizewinning data.

Questions
1. What is the most commonly awarded gender (top_gender) and birth country (top_country)? 
2. Which decade had the highest ratio of US-born Nobel Prize winners to total winners in all categories? (max_decade_usa)
3. Which decade and Nobel Prize category combination had the highest proportion of female laureates? (Store this as a dictionary called max_female_dict where the decade is the key and the category is the value. There should only be one key:value pair.)
4. Who was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, and in what category? (Save your string answers as first_woman_name and first_woman_category.)
5. Which individuals or organizations have won more than one Nobel Prize throughout the years? (Store the full names in a list named repeat_list)
